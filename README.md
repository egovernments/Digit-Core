## What Is DIGIT?

DIGIT is a modular, multi-tenant, microservices API platform designed to accelerate the development and deployment of government-facing services and workflows. It provides reusable, secure, and scalable core building blocks that mission-specific services like Urban, Health, Sanitation, or Public Finance Platforms can leverage and extend.

Built for inclusive governance, DIGIT-Core enables seamless collaboration among citizens, employees, vendors, administrators, and policymakers.
