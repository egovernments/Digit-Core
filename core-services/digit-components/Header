Overview:
A header is a term given to a main strip or icon that sits towards the top of your website. Its purpose is to introduce your branding and send out a message.

When to apply?
1. Apply the header component when you require consistent navigation across multiple pages or sections within your digital product or service.
2. When you need to display branding elements such as logos or brand colors prominently at the top of the page.
3. When you have multiple navigation links that need to be easily accessible to users.
4. When you need flexibility in customizing the appearance and behavior of the navigation interface.

When Not to Apply?
1. In single-page applications where a persistent header is unnecessary.
2. In contexts where screen space is limited and a compact navigation solution is more suitable.
3. When non-standard navigation patterns are required that are not supported by the header component.

How to Apply?
1. Integrate the header component into the project's layout or template.
2. Customize the header component using props such as logo, navigation links, and theme.
3. Test the header component for functionality, responsiveness, and accessibility.
4. Document usage guidelines and customization options for reference.
